Android Sample Project 

Created in Android Studio 3.0. I am using this app to learn how to use Android Studio to build Android applications. I am testing this app on a OnePlus3T and a MotoG3.

For now, this serves the purpose of a clicker app which displays how many times the click button is pressed as well as a reset button to reset the number of clicks (One solution for all your clicking needs!).

This is how the app looks for now.
